//! `rsevents` is an implementation of WIN32's auto- and manual-reset events for the rust world.
//! Events are synchronization primitives (i.e. not implemented atop of mutexes) used to either
//! create other synchronization primitives with or for implementing signalling between threads.
//!
//! Events come in two different flavors: [`AutoResetEvent`] and [`ManualResetEvent`], both
//! implementing the [`Event`] trait for abstracting over the underlying event type. Internally,
//! both are implemented with the unsafe [`RawEvent`] and use the `parking_lot_core` crate to
//! take care of efficiently suspending (parking) threads while they wait for an event to become
//! signalled.
